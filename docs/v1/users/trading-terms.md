# Trading Terms Glossary

## Core Trading Concepts

### **Leverage**

**Example**: With 10x leverage, you can control a $10,000 position with only $1,000 of your own funds.

- **1x Leverage**: No amplification, 1:1 ratio
- **5x Leverage**: 5x amplification, higher risk/reward
- **20x Leverage**: 20x amplification, very high risk

Higher leverage means both profits AND losses are amplified. Use with caution.

## Liquidation

### **Liquidation**
Automatic closing of your position when you don't have enough margin to maintain it.

**When it happens**:
- Your margin falls below maintenance requirements
- Usually due to adverse price movement
- Results in loss of your collateral

### **Liquidation Price**
The price level at which your position will be automatically liquidated.

### **Stop-Loss Order**
