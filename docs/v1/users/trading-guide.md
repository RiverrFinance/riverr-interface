## Trading Strategies for Beginners

### 1. Start Small
- Use 1x-2x leverage initially
- Risk only 1-2% of your portfolio per trade
- Focus on learning the interface

### 2. Use Stop-Losses
- Always set stop-losses to limit downside
- Risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2 (risk $1 to make $2)

### 3. Follow Trends
- Trade in the direction of the overall trend
- Use higher timeframes to identify trend direction

### 4. Practice Position Sizing
- Calculate position size based on stop-loss distance
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose

## Understanding Trading Fees

### Types of Fees

#### Opening/Closing Fees
- **Market Orders**: ~0.1% of position size
- **Limit Orders**: ~0.05% of position size

#### Funding Rates
- **Long positions**: Pay funding when rate is positive
- **Short positions**: Pay funding when rate is negative
- **Frequency**: Usually every 8 hours

#### Liquidation Fees
- Additional fee charged if position gets liquidated
- Usually 1-2% of position size

### Fee Calculation Example

For a $1,000 position:
- Opening fee: $1,000 × 0.1% = $1
- If held for 24 hours: 3 funding payments
- Closing fee: $1,000 × 0.1% = $1

## Risk Management Tips

### Position Sizing Rules

1. **Never risk more than 2% per trade**
2. **Use appropriate leverage**:
   - Beginners: 1x-3x
   - Intermediate: 3x-10x  
   - Advanced: 10x+

3. **Diversify across different assets**
4. **Keep some funds in reserve**

### Liquidation Avoidance
