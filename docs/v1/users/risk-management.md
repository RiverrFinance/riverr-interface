# Risk Management Guide

Learn how to trade safely and protect your capital on Riverr.

## Fundamental Risk Principles

### **Rule #1: Never Risk More Than You Can Afford to Lose**
The most important rule in trading. Only use funds that won't impact your daily life if lost completely.

### **Rule #2: Position Sizing is Everything**
Even the best trading strategy will fail with poor position sizing. Most successful traders risk only 1-2% of their account per trade.

### **Rule #3: Cut Losses Early, Let Winners Run**
Don't let small losses become big ones. Use stop-losses consistently and avoid emotional decision-making.

## Position Sizing Strategies

### **The 2% Rule**
Never risk more than 2% of your total account on a single trade.

**Example Calculation**:
- Account size: $10,000
- Maximum risk per trade: $200 (2%)
- If your stop-loss is $50 away from entry, maximum position size is $4,000 to risk only $200

### **Position Size Formula**

```
Position Size = (Account Size × Risk %) ÷ Stop-Loss Distance
```

**Example**:
- Account: $5,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $50
- Stop-loss: 5% from entry
- Position size: $50 ÷ 0.05 = $1,000

### **Leverage and Position Sizing**

Higher leverage doesn't mean higher position size - it means the same position size with less margin required.

**Conservative approach**:
- Use leverage to reduce required margin
- Keep the same dollar risk amount
- This allows for more trades and better risk distribution

## Stop-Loss Strategies

### **Setting Effective Stop-Losses**

#### **Technical Stop-Losses**
- Below support levels for long positions
- Above resistance levels for short positions  
- Beyond recent swing highs/lows

#### **Percentage-Based Stop-Losses**
- Fixed percentage from entry price
- Long position: 5% below entry
- Short position: 5% above entry

#### **ATR-Based Stop-Losses**
- Use Average True Range (ATR) indicator
- Set stop at 1.5-2x ATR from entry
- Adapts to market volatility

### **Stop-Loss Best Practices**

1. **Set before entering trade** - Never trade without predetermined exit
2. **Don't move stops against you** - Stick to original plan
3. **Consider market volatility** - Wider stops in volatile markets
4. **Account for spreads and slippage** - Set stops slightly wider than exact levels

## Leverage Guidelines

### **Leverage by Experience Level**

| Experience | Recommended Max Leverage |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Beginner | 2x - 3x |
| Intermediate | 5x - 10x |
| Advanced | 10x - 20x |
| Expert | 20x+ (with proper risk management) |

### **Leverage Risk Assessment**

**3x Leverage Example**:
- 10% price move against you = 30% account loss
- Liquidation occurs around 33% adverse move

**10x Leverage Example**:
- 3% price move against you = 30% account loss
- Liquidation occurs around 10% adverse move

:::warning
Higher leverage = faster potential profits BUT also faster potential losses and closer liquidation prices.
:::

## Diversification Strategies

### **Asset Diversification**
Don't put all positions in correlated assets:
- ✅ Good: BTC long + Oil short + EUR/USD long
- ❌ Bad: BTC long + ETH long + ADA long (all crypto, likely correlated)

### **Time Diversification**
Don't open all positions at once:
- Stagger entries over time
- Use dollar-cost averaging for larger positions
- Avoid FOMO-driven simultaneous entries

### **Strategy Diversification**
Use different trading approaches:
- Trend following positions
- Mean reversion trades  
- Breakout strategies
- Fundamental-based trades

## Liquidation Prevention

### **Monitor Key Metrics**

#### **Margin Ratio**
- Keep above 200% for safety buffer
- Add margin when approaching 150%
- Never let it drop below 120%

#### **Liquidation Distance**
- Track how far price can move before liquidation
- Maintain at least 20% buffer from liquidation price
- Consider adding collateral rather than closing profitable positions

### **Emergency Actions**

**When approaching liquidation**:

1. **Add Collateral** - Deposit more funds to increase margin
2. **Reduce Position Size** - Partially close positions to reduce margin requirement  
3. **Close Positions** - Exit before liquidation to save on liquidation fees
4. **Hedge** - Open opposite positions to reduce directional risk

### **Liquidation Fees**
Avoid these extra costs by managing positions proactively:
- Liquidation fee: Usually 1-5% of position size
- Partial liquidation: System may liquidate only part of position
- Full liquidation: Entire position closed at once

## Emotional Risk Management

### **Common Emotional Traps**

#### **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**
- Entering trades without proper analysis
- Chasing price moves that already happened
- **Solution**: Stick to predetermined entry criteria

#### **Revenge Trading**
- Increasing position sizes after losses
- Taking unnecessary risks to "get even"
- **Solution**: Take breaks after significant losses

#### **Overconfidence**
- Increasing risk after winning streaks
- Abandoning risk management rules
- **Solution**: Maintain consistent position sizing regardless of recent performance

### **Psychological Best Practices**

1. **Keep a Trading Journal**
   - Record entry/exit reasons
   - Note emotional state during trades
   - Review monthly for patterns

2. **Set Daily Loss Limits**
   - Stop trading after losing X% in a day
   - Prevents spiraling losses
   - Typical limit: 5-10% of account

3. **Take Regular Breaks**
   - Step away from screens periodically
   - Avoid overtrading
   - Maintain work-life balance

## Portfolio Risk Metrics

### **Maximum Drawdown Limits**
Set maximum acceptable portfolio decline:
- Conservative: 10% max drawdown
- Moderate: 20% max drawdown  
- Aggressive: 30% max drawdown

### **Position Correlation**
Monitor how positions move together:
- Low correlation: Positions move independently
- High correlation: Positions move together (higher risk)
- Use correlation tools to assess portfolio risk

### **Risk-Adjusted Returns**
Focus on return per unit of risk, not just absolute returns:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Return per unit of volatility
- **Sortino Ratio**: Return per unit of downside volatility
- **Calmar Ratio**: Return per unit of maximum drawdown

## Final Risk Management Principles

1. **Consistency Over Perfection**: Follow rules consistently rather than trying to time perfect entries
2. **Preservation Over Profits**: Protecting capital is more important than making profits
3. **Process Over Outcomes**: Focus on following good processes rather than individual trade results
4. **Adaptation Over Rigidity**: Adjust risk based on market conditions and personal circumstances
5. **Education Over Speculation**: Continuously learn and improve rather than gambling

Remember: The goal isn't to never lose money - it's to lose small amounts when wrong and make larger amounts when right, while protecting your trading capital for long-term growth.
